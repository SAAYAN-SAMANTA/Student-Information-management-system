TechStack used Java(EE),JSP,HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,BOOSTRAP,MYSQL database.
<br>
It is developed to manage the lage scale Student information data.

Here am using Tomcat 10 so the import statements are jakarta but if you are using tomcat lower version you can use 'javax' instead of 'jakarta'.
For Tomcat 10 the JSTL 1.2 and the JSTL standard library are based on jarkarta . If u want to install jstl-1.2.jar and jstl-standard.jar then u can also downlaod it from internet.
